Description: An exploratory and heuristic approach for specification search
    in Structural Equation Modeling. The basic idea is to subsample the original
    data and then search for optimal models on each subset. Optimality is defined
    through two objectives: model fit and parsimony. As these objectives are
    conflicting, we apply a multi-objective optimization methods, specifically
    NSGA-II, to obtain optimal models for the whole range of model complexities.
    From these optimal models, we consider only the relevant model specifications
    (structures), i.e., those that are both stable (occur frequently) and
    parsimonious and use those to infer a causal model.
